# Overview

In this project, I was trying to learn more about machine learning, particularly how to make a model using tensorflow. I have been interested in machine learning for a long time, but I haven't tried to sit down and actually make a model till now. 

I used this * [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset) from kaggle. It is has the prices of houses a long with many other datapoints, such as square footage, airconditioning, and even if it's furnished. 

I wrote this software not to make a "housing price predictor" but to understand better how machine learning works. I still don't completely understand everything about the model itself. I learned a lot about data preprocessing and how to transform the data so that the model can understand it and interpret it. I also learned a lot about different models!

Below is a demo video of my software.

# Data Analysis Results

I was able to read a csv file with housing data, clean it, and prepare it for use with my machine learning model. The result was a model that could fairly accurately predict how much a house should cost based off of certain pieces of data.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio code and a lot of googling to be able to learn more about tensorflow, keras, preprocessing data, and more. 

I used python 3.10.2 as my programming language. I used these modules in this project numpy, pandas, tensorflow, and keras.

# Future Work

* I want to use a larger dataset than the one that I'm currently using to see how much that changes the algorithm's predictions.
* I want to figure out how to save and load the model. I looked into it a bit, but it wasn't working, so I put it on the back burner.
* I want to try different models to see if I can find one that will give me more accurate predictions.
